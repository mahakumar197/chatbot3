ChatBot

"Have you ever chatted with a computer? That's what we'll explore today. Chatbots, or virtual conversation partners, are changing the way we interact with technology. In the next few minutes, we'll dive into the world of chatbots, discovering how they work, what they can do, and how they're shaping our digital experiences."

Sword chatbot
To assist you, we have a chatbot named Maha. This is primarily for new Joiners who are unfamiliar with our company. As a result, it will provide a broad introduction.

Features 
Conversational Interface
24/7 Availability
Personalization
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Advanced chatbots use NLP to understand and respond to user input, making interactions more human-like and meaningful.
Cost Savings
Quick Responses
 
Technologies
React JS and bootstrap, CSS,react and its hooks. The technologies we used for the chatbot's front end. I also used git to manage the project's version control. 



Future Integrations

I intend to add a backend to the chat bot to get the best response for the users' requests utilizing apis and responses.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
